# Cleaning Messy Data

In statistics classes, you are typically provided simple, clean datasets to load and analyze with ease.  This is a terrible disservice to anyone who will deal with data outside of the classroom. 

Anyone who works with data will have to do some data wrangling.  Data wrangling is an appropriate description of cleaning, sorting, filtering, summarizing, transforming, and a whole host of other activities to make data usable for a specific purpose.

In this document, we introduce a moderately messy dataset and demonstrate basic programming commands to help us get data ready for analysis or visualization.


# The Tidyverse

All semester, we have been loading a library called `tidyverse`.  Tidyverse is a library of libraries that provides a vast array of tools and a syntax that make wrangling data as simple as possible.  


**NOTE**: Good scientists **NEVER** delete data from original records.  The tidyverse allows us to create a new, clean dataset with a transparent set of steps from which we can create graphs and visualizations without losing any of the original data.


The `tidyverse` can be daunting to learn, but it is easier to demonstrate than to explain. We will work through several examples and have opportunities to practice.


## Additional Resources

Below are 2 great resources for digging a little deeper into data manipulation in R.

Next, we will explain a few programming fundamentals that will help make 

# Fundamentals

We will use a survey of high school students as our motivating example for cleaning data.  Load the libraries and data in the code chunk below.

```{r}

# Load libraries and data

library(readxl)
library(rio)
library(mosaic)
library(tidyverse)
library(car)

survey <- import('https://github.com/byuistats/Math221D_Cannon/raw/master/Data/HighSchoolSeniors_subset.csv') %>% tibble()

```


## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used extensively in computer programming to determine if a certain condition is met.  They always return a "True" or a "False", but we can treat them like a 0 for false and 1 for true. 

We can tell a computer to determine a conditional statement (typically "less than", "greater than" or "not equal to") for specific variables, and it will return a `TRUE` if the statement is true and `FALSE` if not.

### Quantitative Variables

Let's examine the height_cm column in the survey data. 

```{r}

favstats(survey$Height_cm)
hist(survey$Height_cm)

```

The maximum is 999 cm, which is around 33 Feet!  We know this is not a possible value. 

It is very unlikely that a high school student is taller than 7 feet.  We can use a logical operator to see which students are taller than 7 feet (213.36 cm):

```{r}

survey$Height_cm > 213.36

# To illustrate, the below code puts the Survey column, Height_cm, along with the TRUE/FALSE logical
data.frame(Height_cm =survey$Height_cm, logical = survey$Height_cm > 213.36)[73:84,]

```

What does the above code return?

A list of `TRUE` and `FALSE` for every line of the data. It is as long as the number of rows in the dataset.  

### Categorical Variables

We can also use logical operators for categorical data.  For example, if we wanted to see how many people are ambidextrous, we can run the following:

```{r}

# What are unique values in of the respondents?

unique(survey$Handed)

# Use a logical operator to get TRUE and FALSE for students who responded "Ambidextrous" on the survey question about handedness

survey$Handed == "Ambidextrous"

data.frame(Handed = survey$Handed, logical = survey$Handed == 'Ambidextrous')[1:10,]

```


We will show you why this is useful when we introduce tidyverse functions.

## Ceci n'est pas une pipe

The tidyverse organizes actions to data sequentially.  We separate steps by what is called a "pipe" which is programmed `%>%`. 

**HINT**: The shortkey for adding a "pipe" is `ctrl+shift+m` for Windows, and `cmd+shift+m` on Mac. Learn this because we use them a lot!


# Basic Tidyverse Functions

The most frequently used actions used for wrangling data are:

  1. **Filtering rows** - eliminate rows based on certain criteria (logical operators)
  2. **Selecting columns** - narrow the dataset to the specific _columns_ required for the analysis or visualization
  3. **Creating new columns** - create new columns based on the provided data. This could be as simple as changing a height from inches to centimeters.
  4. **Summarizing data** - create customized data summaries, often by specific groups

You have already used `favstats()` to do (4) above, but we'll learn how to do so with more flexibility with the tidyverse.


## Removing Rows - `filter()`

Logical operators are useful when removing rows from a dataset.  The most common logical operators used to filter rows are:

  * `<` and `<=` means "less than" and "less than or equal to" respectively
  * `>` and `>=` means "greater than" and "greater than or equal to" respectively
  * `==` means "equal to" (NOTE:  we use double equals because in most computer languages, a single `=` is an assignment operator.  This avoids ambiguity)
  * `!=` means "not equal to"; this one is useful if you want to eliminate one level of a variable
  * `%in%` is useful for defining a list of levels that you want to include


We typically begin with the raw dataset, then "pipe" that dataset into a sequence of functions using the "pipe" operator, `%>%`.

Let's begin by filtering out rows we think have legitimate heights:

```{r}

survey %>%
  filter(Height_cm < 214)

```

The above code will return a new dataset without the outliers.

How many rows does the original dataset have?

How many rows does the filtered dataset have?


Suppose for some reason, we only want to include right- or left-handed people (excluding ambidextrous).  We can add multiple conditions in the `filter()` function separated by a comma:


```{r}

survey %>%
  filter(Height_cm < 214,
         Handed != "Ambidextrous")

# Equivalently we can use %in% instead of the !=

survey %>%
  filter(Height_cm < 214,
         Handed %in% c("Left-Handed", "Right-Handed"))

```


How many rows does our latest dataset have?


## Adding Columns - `mutate()`

The `mutate()` statement is used to add new columns to a dataset.  

To create a new column, "pipe" the previous steps into the `mutate()` statement. Inside the parentheses, give the new column a name and set it equal to what you want that column to be.  

EXAMPLE:  Create a column of the ratio of Height to armspan called, ht_to_span, by using a `mutate()` statement:

```{r}

survey %>%
  filter(Height_cm < 214,
         Handed != "Ambidextrous") %>%
  mutate(ht_to_span = Height_cm / Armspan_cm)

```

Notice we no longer have to use `$` to access specific columns! The tidyverse lives up to its name!

## Selecting Columns - `select()`

There are now over 60 columns in this dataset.  Suppose we are only interested in reaction times and height-to-armspan ratio as they related to handedness.  To tidy up the data even further, select only the columns we are interested in (Handed, Reaction_time, and ht_to_span):

```{r}

survey %>%
  filter(Height_cm < 214,
         Handed != "Ambidextrous") %>%
  mutate(ht_to_span = Height_cm / Armspan_cm) %>%
  select(Handed, Reaction_time, ht_to_span)

```

See how much we can do in just a few short, sequential lines of code?  Let's name out clean dataset, `clean`, and create a boxplot of reaction times comparing left and right handed students:

```{r}
clean <- survey %>%
  filter(Height_cm < 214,
         Handed != "Ambidextrous") %>%
  mutate(ht_to_span = Height_cm / Armspan_cm) %>%
  select(Handed, Reaction_time, ht_to_span)

boxplot(clean$Reaction_time ~ clean$Handed)

# Modify the code to remove outliers in Reaction_time and remake the boxplot

clean <- survey %>%
  filter(Height_cm < 214,
         Handed != "Ambidextrous") %>%
  mutate(ht_to_span = Height_cm / Armspan_cm) %>%
  select(Handed, Reaction_time, ht_to_span)

boxplot(clean$Reaction_time ~ clean$Handed)

```


## Summarising Data - `group_by()` + `summarise()`

The above data might be adequate for a visualization or analysis, but we can calculate summary statistics tables like we did with `favstats()` using the tidyverse. 

The `summarise()` (or equivalently, `summarize()`) function is like the mutate statement. We create a name for the new column and set it equal to what we want.  

Let's name the new dataset, `clean`, and see how to make summaries using tidyverse. 

```{r}

clean <- survey %>%
  filter(Height_cm < 214,
         Handed != "Ambidextrous",
         Reaction_time < 1) %>%
  mutate(ht_to_span = Height_cm / Armspan_cm) %>%
  select(Handed, Reaction_time, ht_to_span)



clean %>%
  summarise(
    mn_react_time = mean(Reaction_time, na.rm=TRUE),
    med_react_time = median(Reaction_time, na.rm=TRUE),
    mn_ratio = mean(ht_to_span, na.rm=TRUE)
  )


```


Notice that the mn_ratio is `Inf`.  

Why might that be the case?  

Modify the code chunk to exclude rows where arm span is 0:


```{r}

clean <- survey %>%
  filter(Height_cm < 214,
         Handed != "Ambidextrous",
         Reaction_time < 1) %>%
  mutate(ht_to_span = Height_cm / Armspan_cm) %>%
  select(Handed, Reaction_time, ht_to_span)



clean %>%
  summarise(
    mn_react_time = mean(Reaction_time, na.rm=TRUE),
    med_react_time = median(Reaction_time, na.rm=TRUE),
    mn_ratio = mean(ht_to_span, na.rm=TRUE)
  )


```


If we want to get means for separate groups, we can add a `group_by()` statement to tell which variable(s) we want to group by:


```{r}

clean <- survey %>%
  filter(Height_cm < 214,
         Handed != "Ambidextrous",
         Reaction_time < 1,
         Armspan_cm > 0) %>%
  mutate(ht_to_span = Height_cm / Armspan_cm) %>%
  select(Handed, Reaction_time, ht_to_span)



clean %>%
  group_by(Handed) %>%
  summarise(
    mn_react_time = mean(Reaction_time, na.rm=TRUE),
    med_react_time = median(Reaction_time, na.rm=TRUE),
    mn_ratio = mean(ht_to_span, na.rm=TRUE),
    max_react = max(Reaction_time),
    count = n()
  )

```

The `n()` is very useful for counting up the number of observations in each group.  

If we were only interested in the summary statistics table, we can do everything in one series of steps:

```{r}

summary_stats_table <-  survey %>%
  filter(
    Height_cm < 214,
    Handed != "Ambidextrous",
    Reaction_time < 1,
    Armspan_cm > 0) %>%
  mutate(ht_to_span = Height_cm / Armspan_cm) %>%
  select(Handed, Reaction_time, ht_to_span) %>%
  group_by(Handed) %>%
  summarise(
    mn_react_time = mean(Reaction_time, na.rm=TRUE),
    med_react_time = median(Reaction_time, na.rm=TRUE),
    mn_ratio = mean(ht_to_span, na.rm=TRUE),
    max_react = max(Reaction_time),
    count = n()
  )

summary_stats_table

```


# Practice Together

Suppose we want to see who gets more sleep on non-school nights, males or females whose chosen superpower is telepathy.  Also, create a column that is the ratio of sleep hours on non-school nights to 8.  This calculates the percent of recommended sleep on non-school nights.    

  1. Create a dataset that includes columns Gender, Superpower, Sleep_Hours_Non-Schoolnight, and the ratio of non-schoolnight sleep hours divided by 8, for Males and Females who choose Telepathy as their superpower.
  
  2. Create a summary table comparing males and females whose preferred super power is telepathy that includes:
  
    a. Mean, median, standard deviation, and sample size of Sleep Hours on non-school nights 
    b. Mean, median, standard deviation, and sample size of the percent of recommended sleep

**HINT**:  Use the `unique()` function to see what the options are for a given categorical variable.

```{r}


```

# Your Turn

Use the above `tidyverse` functions to answer the following questions:

1. How many vegetarians say meat is their favorite food?

**HINT**: This can be done with a filter statement

```{r}

```

2. Compare mean, median, and standard deviation of heights and the sample size between those who are vegetarian and those who aren't.

Be sure to filter out any major outliers in heights first.

```{r}


```

  3. Create a dataset that:
      a. Includes a column that is _percent of recommended sleep_ (Sleep_Hours_Schoolnight divided by 8 using a mutate statement)
      
      b. Includes only columns for Favourite_physical_activity, Reaction_time, percent_recommended_sleep (part a)
      
      c. Includes only students whose favorite physical activity is Walking/Hiking, Basketball, Swimming, Soccer
      
      d. Filters Reaction Times to be less than 1 second
      

```{r}


```


Use the clean dataset to:

  4. Create a side-by-side boxplot for the percent of recommended sleep for each favorite physical activity

  5. Create a side-by-side boxplot for the reaction times for each favorite physical activity


```{r}


```
