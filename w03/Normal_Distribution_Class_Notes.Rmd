# The Normal Distribution

In your reading, you learned about the normal distribution which is a probability model that can calculate probabilities for certain types of events that follow a normal distribution.  

For example, scores on the ACT exam are normally distributed with a mean of 21 and a standard deviation of 5.  Let's say we really wanted to get into Stanford which requires a 33 or higher on the ACT.  We can calculate the probability of a random test taker getting into Stanford (if we're basing it on test score alone.)

We can first calculate a Z-score, which is the number of standard deviations a score is away from the mean. 

I always recommend drawing a picture first.  Without doing any math, you can usually make a pretty good guess about what the Z-score will be.  

We can calculate a Z-score using the formula $Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} $ where $\mu$ is the mean of the normal distribution and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.  

There is a function in R that calculates the probabilities for these values.

```{r}

# To calculate a z-score, you can use R like a calculator:

x <- 33
mu <- 21
stdev <- 5
z <- (x-mu) / stdev

z

# By default, pnorm() gives us the area to the LEFT of our observation

prob_less_than_x <- pnorm(x, mean = mu, sd = stdev)
prob_greater_than_x <- 1 - prob_less_than_x

prob_less_than_x
prob_greater_than_x


# Z is what we call the Standard Normal Distribution. It has a mean of 0 and a SD of 1.  No matter what our original distribution is, if we subtract the mean and divide by the SD we get a distribution with a mean of 0 and an SD = 1.  

# If X is normally distributed, then (X-Mu)/SD is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and SD = 1.  So we can use:

pnorm(z) ## Left Tail
1-pnorm(z) ## Right Tail

```



# Practice

## IQ Scores

If IQ is normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a Standard Deviation of 11, what's the probability of a randomly selected person having an IQ GREATER than 127?

What about the probability of a randomly selected person having an IQ LESS than 85?


```{r}

x <- 
mu <- 
stdev <- 

z <- (x-mu) / stdev
  
pnorm(z)  # LESS THAN
1-pnorm(z) # GREATER THAN

```


## Brisket Competition

Competition was tight at a Saint Louis BBQ competition.  Brisket scores were normally distributed with an average score of 5.941 with a standard deviation of 0.04.  

What's the probability of getting a score GREATER than 6?

What's the probability of getting a score LESS than 4?


```{r}

x <- 6
mu <- 
stdev <- 

z <- (x-mu) / stdev
  
pnorm(z)  # LESS THAN
1-pnorm(z) # GREATER THAN

```


## Prbability of a "False Start"

“At high level meets, the time between the gun and first kick against the starting block is measured electronically, via sensors built in the gun and the blocks. A reaction time less than 0.1 s is considered a false start. The 0.2-second interval accounts for the sum of the time it takes for the sound of the starter's pistol to reach the runners' ears, and the time they take to react to it.” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres) 
Let's suppose that reaction times are normally distributed with a mean of 0.2 seconds and a standard deviation of 0.03.  

What's the probability of a false start? (that is a reaction time LESS than 0.1)

```{r}

x <- .1
mu <- .2
stdev <- .03

z <- (x-mu) / stdev
  
pnorm(z)  # LESS THAN
1-pnorm(z) # GREATER THAN

```
```{r}
#crime
x <- 723/100000
mu <-  367/100000
stdev <- 160/100000
z <- (x-mu) / stdev
z

pnorm(z)  # LESS THAN
1-pnorm(z) # GREATER THAN

```

# Area BETWEEN 2 Points

If IQ scores have a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 11, we can find the area between two numbers be subtracting the left tail area of the lower number from the left tail area of the higher number.  

What is the probability that a randomly selected individual will have an IQ between 84 and 109?

```{r}

mu <- 
stdev <- 

LowerPoint <- 
UpperPoint <- 

# Area Between:
pnorm(UpperPoint, mu, stdev) - pnorm(LowerPoint, mu, stdev) 

```



# Percentiles

Finding percentiles of a normal distribution is easy in R!  Remember that a percentile is the percent of the population below a given value.  So someone who scores in the 92nd-percentile scores above 92% of the population. 

In R, we use the "qnorm()".  The "Q" in qnorm() stands for quantile (which is a synonym for percentile and for whatever reason is what R uses for percentiles).

```{r}

# for a normal distribution with mean, mu, and standard deviation, stdev, we can find a percentile using the following code:

mu <- 
stdev <- 
percentile <- 

qnorm(percentile, mu, stdev)

```
