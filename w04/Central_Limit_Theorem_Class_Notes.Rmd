# The Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem states that for a large enough sample size ($n>30$) the distribution of _sample means_ is approximately normal with mean, $\mu_{\bar{x}} = \mu$ and $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ regardless of the distribution of the population.  

We can assume the distribution of sample means is approximately normal if:

1. The population is normally distributed
2. n > 30

Don't forget, that if the population is normally distributed, so is the distribution of sample means __regardless of sample size__. 

# Probability Calculations for the Sampling Distribution of $\bar{x}$

When we are confident that the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ is normal, we can use the `pnorm()` function just as we did before.  We simply input the mean, $\mu_{\bar{x}} = \mu$ and $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ into the Z-score formula as follows:  

```{r}

xbar <- 13.5
mu <- 20
sigma <- 15
n <- 33
sigma_xbar <- sigma / sqrt(n)

z <- (xbar - mu) / (sigma_xbar)
z

# Left tail [Prob(some sample mean LESS THAN xbar)]
pnorm(z)

# Right tail [Prob(some sample mean GREATER THAN xbar)]
1-pnorm(z)

# The probability of a sample mean being between A and B

A <- 9
B <- 15
pnorm(B, mu, sigma_xbar) - pnorm(A, mu, sigma_xbar)

# Calculating Percentiles: What is the sample mean below which a certain percent is found? 

qnorm(.25, mu, sigma_xbar)


```

# One Z Formula to Rule Them All

We do not have to worry about choosing between two different Z-score formulas (one for individuals and a separate one for means).  

If we are calculating probabilities for a normal population and we want to calculate the probability of a single individual, we can simply set $n=1$.  

_WARNING_:  Using sample size of 1 only works if the population is already normally distributed.  But if we confident that it is, we can use the following calculations:  

```{r}

xbar <- 13.5
mu <- 20
sigma <- 15
sigma_xbar <- sigma / sqrt(n)
n <- 1

z <- (xbar - mu) / (sigma_xbar)
z

# Left tail [Prob(some sample mean LESS THAN xbar)]
pnorm(z)

# Right tail [Prob(some sample mean GREATER THAN xbar)]
1-pnorm(z)

```


# Practice Together

Use the following calculator to answer the questions below.  __REMEMBER__: Whenever you update information, it is useful to run the whole code chunk.  

```{r, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

x_bar <- 
mu <- 
sigma <- 
n <- 
sigma_xbar <- sigma / sqrt(n)
sigma_xbar

z <- (x_bar-mu) / sigma_xbar
z

# left tail
pnorm(z)
# Right Tail
1-pnorm(z)


A <- 
B <- 
pnorm(B, mu, sigma_xbar) - pnorm(A, mu, sigma_xbar)

# Percentile
qnorm(.25, mu, sigma_xbar)

```



## GPA's

Suppose the mean GPA of BYU-Idaho students is 3.5 and the standard deviation is 0.7. It is well known that this distribution is left-skewed. A random sample of n = 45 students will be drawn.

_Question 1_: What is the mean of the distribution of the sample means (sampling distribution) for all possible samples of size 45 that could be drawn from the parent population of GPAs? 

_Question 2_:  What is the standard deviation of the distribution of the sample means (sampling distribution) for all possible samples of size 45 that could be drawn from the parent population?


_Question 3_:  What is the probability that the mean GPA for 45 randomly selected BYU-Idaho students will be less than 3.3?


_Question 4_:  What is the shape of the distribution of sample means, $\bar{x}$, 45 students are selected in each of the possible random samples?


## GRE Scores

Scores on the quantitative portion of the GRE are approximately normally distributed with mean, $\mu=150.8$,
 and standard deviation $\sigma = 8.8$.
 
_Question 1_:  Dianne earned a score of 160 on the quantitative portion of the GRE. What is the z-score corresponding to Dianneâ€™s score? 


_Question 2_:  What is the probability that a randomly selected student will score above 160 on the quantitative portion of the GRE?


_Question 3_: What is the probability that a randomly selected group of 18 students will have an *average* less than 160 on the quantitative portion of the GRE?


_Question 4_: What is the probability that a randomly selected group of 18 students will have an *average* between 145 and 160 on the quantitative portion of the GRE?

```{r, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

x_bar <- 160
mu <- 150.8
sigma <- 8.8
n <- 1
sigma_xbar <- sigma / sqrt(n)
sigma_xbars

z <- (x_bar-mu) / sigma_xbar
z

# left tail
pnorm(z)
# Right Tail
1-pnorm(z)


A <- 
B <- 
pnorm(B, mu, sigma_xbar) - pnorm(A, mu, sigma_xbar)

# Percentile
qnorm(.25, mu, sigma_xbar)

```
