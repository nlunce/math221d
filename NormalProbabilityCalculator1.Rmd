```{r}

# Sample Mean
x <- 157

# Hypothesized Mean
mu <- 150.7

# Population Standard deviation
sigma <- 10.2

# Z-score:  number of standard deviations above the mean
z <- (x-mu) / sigma
z


# Probability of observing a z-score LESS THAN the one we observed (left tail)
pnorm(z)

# Probability of observing a z-score GREATER THAN the one we observed (Right Tail)
1-pnorm(z)


# For calculating the area between 2 numbers
A <- 61.5
B <- 68.5
pnorm(B, mu, sigma) - pnorm(A, mu, sigma)

# Find the X_bar associated with a spceific percentile
qnorm(.35, mu, sigma)
